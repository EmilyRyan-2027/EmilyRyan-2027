### Howdy! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Emily Ryan (they/them), and I study Computer Science and Music Technology at Northeastern University! 

A little bit about me: I appreciate the rigor and standards of technical subjects, but I have also been in love with the arts my entire life. Most of all I take great interest in the areas where technical and creative overlap. I'm open-minded about my future, but I think it would be really cool to create tools that help human beings express themselves.
